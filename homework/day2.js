/*
 Exercise one:
 Take an array of numbers (for example, let a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];)
 and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.
 For practice, write this code inside a function.

/*
Exercise two:
Take an array, (for example, let array1 = [ [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89];)
and return all elements less than 5 For practice, write this code inside a function.


Bonus: 
Instead of logging the elements one by one,
make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.

/*
Exercise three:
Write a function to check if the input is an array
Hint: What does Array.isArray(Value); do?
